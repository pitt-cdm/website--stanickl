  <h1> To Start Out... </h1>
	        <p> I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on December 17, 1997. I'm a huge music and movie geek and will talk about them for hours. I'm the middle child with two brothers, awesome parents, and a sassy cat and sweet puppy. </p>
	        
	        <p> I'm a huge sports fan, and my favorite teams are the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and the St. Louis Cardinals. </p>
	        
	        <p> My family is really into Disney, and my older brother is a cast member, so we go down once a summer to see the newest attactions. Below is a picture of my brothers and I on the Hollywood Tower of Terror!

      <h2> School </h2> 
        <p> Right now I'm a double degree student at the University of Pittsburgh studying Theatre Arts and Media & Professional Communications. </p>
        
        <p> My extra curriculars include sound designing shows for University of Pittsburgh Stages, playing alto sax in Pitt's varsity marching band, and acting in the Redeye Theatre Project festivals!

 	 </div>
	</p>
        
        <p> After I graduate I plan on taking a year off to work and save up a little money. I would like to apply to graduate school for acting, creative writing, or film studies. </p>
        <h3> Theatre </h3>
        
          <p> I <em> love </em> theatre. I was inspired to pursue theatre in college after I first listened to the original broadway
              cast soundtrack of Hamilton. It was so inspiring and made me want to pursue a career of creativity and performance.

          <p> There are so many way a person can express their creativity: acting, spoken word, dance, music. All of these types of 
              expression can be incorporated into a theatrical performance. The space for creativity is infinite. </p>
          
          <p> Right now I'm focused on sound designing and acting with University of Pittsbugh Stages. I'm honing skills and hope to be working 
              on mainstage shows before I graduate. Below are posters of lab shows that I've designed.
